# NET Core Web API Project with Swagger, Entity Framework & MySQL

Project with clean architecture. I started the project on endpoints, but now it works on controllers. Controllers were added with unit tests first to the new branch and then merged to main.
The project includes Repository Pattern, Swagger Documentation, Custom HTTP Exception Handler, Validators, Custom File Logger. 
Connection string in the User Secrets json file wich ignored by Git. Added some Unit tests.
